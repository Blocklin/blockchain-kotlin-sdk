For more information on Moralis and its features, see [the website](https://moralis.io), [the JavaScript guide](https://docs.moralis.io), [the Cloud Code guide](https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/cloud-code) or [Web3 Reference](https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/web3-sdk/intro).

## Getting Started

The easiest way to integrate the Moralis SDK into your Android project is through adding the dependency to your buid.gradle file:

    implementation 'com.github.mobilekosmos:moralis-sdk-android:<Tag>'

where '< Tag >' is the latest released version on Github, please check.
You can also use "master-SNAPSHOT" but this is not recommended, as the master is not approved for production.

## Disclaimer
This is a proof of work, not ready for production yet, work in progress.
